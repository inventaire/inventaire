# Keep our entitiesSearchEngine instance updated by requesting it
# to update its data everytime an entity with a type is requested here:
# Every cache miss triggers an update request, meaning that 'refresh' request
# are also propagated to the search engine \o/
# see https://github.com/inventaire/wikidata-subset-search-engine

# Other advantage of requesting update from here:
# - we already have the logic to determine the entity's type
# - it allows to keep the access to the search engine update endpoint restricted:
#   the endpoint can trust the input entity type to be true without having to
#   check it itself
