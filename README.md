This repository hosts [Inventaire.io](https://inventaire.io) source code. Its a collaborative resources mapper project, while yet only focused on exploring books mapping with [wikidata](https://wikidata.org/) and [ISBNs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Standard_Book_Number)

This repository tracks the server-side developments, while the (heavy) [client-side can be found here](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-client). Client-related technical issues should go in the client repo, while this repo gathers all other technical issues. Non-technical discussions such as feature requests should preferably happen in the [roadmap](https://roadmap.inventaire.io). In doubt, just use your best guess or come ask on the chat :)

## Installation

*This is the installation documentation for a developement environment. For production setup, see*: [inventaire-deploy](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-deploy)

### Dependencies to install manually
- [git](https://git-scm.com/), [curl](https://curl.haxx.se) (used in some installation scripts), [graphicsmagick](www.graphicsmagick.org/README.html) (used to resize images), [inotify-tools](https://github.com/rvoicilas/inotify-tools) (used in API tests scripts):
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) (>=8, using the latest LTS is recommended), [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) (allows greater version update flexibility)
- a [CouchDB](https://couchdb.apache.org/) (>=3.1) instance (on port 5984 for default config)
- an [Elasticsearch](https://www.elastic.co/fr/products/elasticsearch) (>=7.10) instance (on port 9200 for default config)

To install all this those dependencies on Ubuntu 20.04:

For packages available in Ubuntu default repositories:
```sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git curl wget graphicsmagick inotify-tools
```
For packages that need a more elaborated installation, see their own documentation:
* [Install NodeJS latest LTS via NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
* [Install CouchDB](https://docs.couchdb.org/en/stable/install/unix.html)
* [Install ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/7.14/deb.html)

Alternatively, CouchDB and Elasticsearch could be run in Docker:
* Install [`docker`](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [`docker-compose`](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* Get the `docker-compose.yml`:
```sh
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/inventaire/docker-inventaire/master/docker-compose.yml
```
* Run `couchdb` and `elasticsearch` services in the background:
```sh
docker-compose up -d couchdb elasticsearch
```

Whatever the way you installed CouchDB and Elasticsearch, you should now be able to get a response from them:
```sh
# Verify that CouchDB is up
curl http://localhost:5984
# Verify that Elasticsearch is up
curl http://localhost:9200
```

### Project development environment installation
```sh
git clone https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire.git
cd inventaire
npm install
```

This should have installed:
- the server (this git repository) in the current directory
- the client ([inventaire-client](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-client)) in the `client` directory
- i18n strings ([inventaire-i18n](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-i18n)) in the `inventaire-i18n` directory

#### server

The installation step above should have triggered the creation of a `./config/local.js` file, in which you can override all present in `./config/default.js`: make sure to set `db` `username` and `password` to your CouchDB username and password.

And now you should be all set! You can now start the server (on port `3006` by default)
```sh
# Starting the server in watch mode so that it reboots on file changes
npm run watch
```

##### emails

To debug emails in the browser:
* Set the following values in config: `mailer.disabled = false` and `mailer.preview = true`.
* Install `live-server`: `npm install --global live-server`
* Make an action that triggers the email you would like to work on on the local server (ex: send a friend request)
* Run `npm run preview-email`: this will open the last generated email in your browser (with a link to the data associated to the email, that's only there in this preview mode)

Note that, while convenient, debugging emails in the browser is quite an approximation, as some email clients are antiquated, and, sadly, modern CSS can't be used.

#### client

If you want to work on the [client](https://github.com/inventaire/inventaire-client), you need to start the webpack watcher and dev server (on port `3005` by default)
```sh
# In another terminal
cd inventaire/client
npm run watch
```

### Installation tips
* To use executable that are used by the project (such as `mocha`), you can either find them in `./node_modules/.bin` or install them globally with npm: `npm install -g mocha supervisor lev2` etc.

### Repositories and Branches

- [**master**](https://github.com/inventaire/docker-inventaire/tree/master): tracking docker installation files for development and testing use

## Stack Map
This repo correspond to the the "Server" section in the [stack map](https://inventaire.github.io/stack/)

## Concepts map
the app has a few core concepts:
- Users
- Entities : which can be authors (ex: [wd:Q353](https://inventaire.io/entity/wd:Q535)), books (ex: [wd:Q393018](https://inventaire.io/entity/wd:Q393018)) and books' specific editions (ex: [isbn:9782070389162](https://inventaire.io/entity/isbn:9782070389162)). The term *entities* comes from wikidata terminology. See the [entities map](https://inventaire.github.io/entities-map/).
- Items : instances of book entities that a user says they have. It can be an instance of a work or a specific edition of a work.
- Transactions : discussion between two users about a specific item with an open transaction mode (giving, lending, selling). Transactions have effects on items: giving and selling an item make it move from the owner to the requester inventory; lending an item shows it as unavailable.
- Groups: groups of users with one or more admins
