// - 'redirects' is the name Wikidata uses to signal redirections as an object
// with a 'from' and a 'to', and that was thus adopted here too: those 'redirects'
// objects signal constated redirections.
// - 'redirect' is the attribute by which an entity document redirected to another
// entity keeps track of this redirection

// The entity is expected to be formatted, so that it's uri is defined
