### Install

What you need to install will depend on if you are trying to set up a development or a production environment:
* In **development**, you will need the server and client repositories of course, and their dependencies: **CouchDB**, **Elasticsearch**, **GraphicsMagick**
* In **production**, in addition to those dependencies, you will need a reverse proxy, typically **Nginx**, to handle TLS termination, image resizing and caching, etc

For details on how to install all of those:
* See [installation](./installation) procedure for Debian-based systems.
* See [Docker Inventaire Suite](https://git.inventaire.io/docker-inventaire) for a fully packaged federated production-ready instance
* For other operating systems and setups, see [install on another OS](./installation/README.md#install-on-other-operating-systems)
