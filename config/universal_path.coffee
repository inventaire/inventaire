# This is where all the path magic happens!
# By always passing by this module that nows the appRoot
# we can copy dependency imports from one file to the other
# without even having a look to which directory we are in.

# Example:

#> CONFIG = require 'config'
#> __ = CONFIG.universalPath
#> Item = __.require 'models', 'item'

# Pasting those 3 lines anywhere in the code base will have the same result:
#> require "#{appRoot}/server/models/item"

# Goodbye '../../../models/item' hard to maintain horrors, hello Freedom, Easyness and Beauty!

# The only downside I see is that it might be less clear for new comers
# to this code base to find the dependencies involved in a given module:
# if you did arrive here because you had this kind of difficulties
# and that those explanation aren't clear enough, please open an issue
# to help make it clearer

appRoot = __dirname.replace '/config', ''
